    <description>Streamlink is a CLI utility that pipes flash videos from online streaming services to a variety of video players such as VLC, or alternatively, a browser.

The main purpose of streamlink is to convert CPU-heavy flash plugins to a less CPU-intensive format.

Streamlink is a fork of the [livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) project.</description>
